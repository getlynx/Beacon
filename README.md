Full-screen terminal UI for managing a LYNX blockchain node. Built with Textual.

## Quick start (placeholder)

```
wget -qO- https://example.com/lynx-tui/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

This downloads and runs the installer, which sets up dependencies, installs the app,
and enables a sync-wait service that launches the TUI after the node finishes syncing.
